Continue building the Solana-based anime casino website Nightfall Casino. Integrate the following luck-based PVP games, all driven by player stakes, no admin-funded prizes, and deeply themed around a dreamy, night-city atmosphere inspired by Call of the Night.
After a user has opened a game by themselves after betting their chosen amount of SOL (min 0.001 SOL) for other people to join, they can not cancel the game at will, but they can cancel the game and receive their SOL (with transaction fee, no playing fee) after a 5 minute Timeframe that is displayed clearly for them, after the 5 minute is up the user can cancel the game and get his SOL back (with transaction fee)

Games to Implement

1.  Moon Flip

A Solana-themed coin flip:

6.  Mystery Box Duel

Set/change fee destination wallet

Apply consistently across all games:

Visuals: dark purples, navy, gold accents, glowing outlines

Animation: smooth, floating, neon-inspired transitions

Sound:

No loud builds or arcade FX

Use ambient night sounds, soft win tones, gentle hover FX


Chat & UI: toast notifications, streak effects, glowing badges

Fully responsive, optimized for Vercel deployment

Use Tailwind CSS + React, modular component structure

Allow users to either Create Private Game or Join Public Game

⚙️ Payout Structure for Multiplayer

All players stake the same fixed amount (minimum: 0.001 SOL)

One winner receives:

Total pool – 0.0001 SOL playing fee based on how many players joined

Example: if 5 people were to play a game and one of them wins, the playing fee will be 0.0005 SOL


Playing fee goes to admin wallet (adjustable via Admin Panel)

In 1v1, winner gets the other player’s stake (same logic)

Gameplay

Streak-Based Betting Buffs
Visual-only effects (glows, badges) during gameplay and leaderboard when a user is on a win streak.

Side Wagers for Snake & Ladder

Spectate Mode (Optimized)
Allow users to watch ongoing Snake & Ladder games with synced moves, chat, and effects (no performance drop).
